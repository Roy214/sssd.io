SSSD 2.6.3 Release Notes
========================

Highlights
----------

Important fixes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* A regression introduced in sssd-2.6.2 in the IPA provider that prevented users from login was fixed. Access control always denied access because the selinux_child returned an unexpected reply.
* A critical regression that prevented authentication of users via AD and IPA providers was fixed. LDAP port was reused for Kerberos communication and this provider would send incomprehensible information to this port.
* When authenticating AD users, backtrace was triggered even though everything was working correctly. This was caused by a search in the global catalog. Servers from the global catalog are filtered out of the list before writing the KDC info file. With this fix, SSSD does not attempt to write to the KDC info file when performing a GC lookup.

SSSD 1.16.4 Release Notes
=========================

Highlights
----------

New Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  The list of PAM services which are allowed to authenticate using a Smart Card is now configurable using a new option ``pam_p11_allowed_services``. (#2926)
-  A new configuration option ``ad_gpo_implicit_deny`` was added. This option (when set to True) can be used to deny access to users even if there is not applicable GPO. Normally users are allowed access in this situation. (#3701)
-  The LDAP authentication provider now allows to use a different method of changing LDAP passwords using a modify operation in addition to the default extended operation. This is meant to support old LDAP servers that do not implement the extended operation. The password change using the modification operation can be selected with ``ldap_pwmodify_mode = "ldap_modify"`` (#1314)
-  The ``auto_private_groups`` configuration option now takes a new value ``hybrid``. This mode autogenerates private groups for user entries where the UID and GID values have the same value and at the same time the GID value does not correspond to a real group entry in LDAP (#3822)

Security issues fixed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  CVE-2019-3811: SSSD used to return "/" in case a user entry had no home directory. This was deemed a security issue because this flaw could impact services that restrict the user's filesystem access to within their home directory. An empty home directory field would indicate "no filesystem access", where sssd reporting it as "/" would grant full access (though still confined by unix permissions, SELinux etc).

Notable bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  The IPA provider, in a setup with a trusted Active Directory domain, did not remove cached entries that were no longer present on the AD side (#3984)
-  The Active Directory provider now fetches the user information from the LDAP port and switches to using the Global Catalog port, if available for the group membership. This fixes an issue where some attributes which are not available in the Global Catalog, typically the home directory, would be removed from the user entry. (#2474)
-  The IPA SELinux provider now sets the user login context even if it is the same as the system default. This is important in case the user has a non-standard home directory, because then only adding the user to the SELinux database ensures the home directory will be labeled properly. However, this fix causes a performance hit during the first login as the context must be written into the semanage database.
-  The sudo responder did not reflect the case_sensitive domain option (#3820)
-  A memory leak when requesting netgroups repeatedly was fixed (#3870)
-  An issue that caused SSSD to sometimes switch to offline mode in case not all domains in the forest ran the Global Catalog service was fixed (#3902)
-  The SSH responder no longer fails completely if the ``p11_child`` times out when deriving SSH keys from a certificate (#3937)
-  The negative cache was not reloaded after new sub domains were discovered which could have lead to a high SSSD load (#3683)
-  The negative cache did not work properly for in case a lookup fell back to trying a UPN instead of a name (#3978)
-  If any of the SSSD responders was too busy, that responder wouldn't have refreshed the trusted domain list (#3967)
-  A potential crash due to a race condition between the fail over code refreshing a SRV lookup and back end using its results (#3976)
-  Sudo's runAsUser and runAsGroup attributes did not match properly when used in setups with domain_resolution_order
-  Processing of the values from the ``filter_users`` or ``filter_groups`` options could trigger calls to blocking NSS API functions which could in turn prevent the startup of SSSD services in case nsswitch.conf contained other modules than ``sss`` or ``files`` (#3963)

Packaging Changes
-----------------

-  Several files in the reference specfile changed permissions to avoid issues with verifying the file integrity with ``rpm -V`` in case SSSD runs as a different user than the default user it is configured with (#3890)

Documentation Changes
---------------------

-  The AD provider default value of ``fallback_homedir`` was changed to ``fallback_homedir = /home/%d/%u`` to provide home directories for users without the ``homeDirectory`` attribute.
-  A new option ``ad_gpo_implicit_deny``, defaulting to False (#3701)
-  A new option ``ldap_pwmodify_mode`` (#1314)
-  A new option ``pam_p11_allowed_services`` (#2926)
-  The ``auto_private_groups`` accepts a new option value ``hybrid`` (#3822)

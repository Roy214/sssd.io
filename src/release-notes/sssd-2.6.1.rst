SSSD 2.6.1 Release Notes
========================

Highlights
----------

New features
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* New infopipe method ``FindByValidCertificate()`` which accepts the certificate as input, validates it against configured CAs, and outputs the user path on success. This is similar to the existing ``FindByCertificate()``, but that does not do any trust validation.

Packaging changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* ``subid ranges`` support was enabled by default.

Configuration changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Default value of ``ssh_hash_known_hosts`` setting was changed to false for the sake of consistency with OpenSSH that does not hash host names by default.
